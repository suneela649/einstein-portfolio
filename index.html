             <section class="about-content">
                <p>Albert Einstein, (born March 14, 1879, Ulm, Württemberg, Germany—died April 18, 1955, Princeton, New Jersey, U.S.), German-born physicist who developed the special and general theories of relativity and won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1921 for his explanation of the photoelectric effect. Einstein is generally considered the most influential physicist of the 20th century. <br />
                    Einstein’s parents were secular, middle-class Jews. His father, Hermann Einstein, was originally a featherbed salesman and later ran an electrochemical factory with moderate success. His mother, the former Pauline Koch, ran the family household. He had one sister, Maria (who went by the name Maja), born two years after Albert.

            <p><strong><em>Special Theory of Relativity, 1905 -</em></strong> Special relativity is an explanation of how speed affects mass, time and space.The theory is based on two postulates: 1. The laws of physics are invariant in all inertial frames of reference. 2. The speed of light in vacuum is the same for all observers, regardless of the motion of the light source or observer.The theory includes a way for the speed of light to define the relationship between energy and matter — small amounts of mass (m) can be interchangeable with enormous amounts of energy (E), as defined by the classic equation <strong>E = mc^2.</strong></p>
            <p><strong><em>General Theory of Relativity, 1916 - </em></strong>General relativity explains the law of gravitation and its relation to other forces of nature. It says gravity is a curving or wraping of space. The more massive an object, the more it wraps the space around it.  </p>
            <p><strong><em>Investigations on Theory of Brownian Movement, 1926 - </em></strong>This time, the subject was the kinetic theory of gases, but the paper was  groundbreaking in its conclusions.It says if tiny but visible particles were suspended in a liquid, the invisible atoms in the liquid would bombard the suspended particles and cause them to jiggle.This motion is named after the botanist Robert Brown.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Why War?, 1933 - </em></strong>A letter to Sigmund Freud. Is there a way of freeing humankind from the threat of war? Can human aggression be channeled to help protect people against the impulses of hatred and destruction? These questions were put to Sigmund Freud in an anxious letter.</p>
            <p><strong><em>The Evolution of Physics, 1938 - </em></strong>he Growth of Ideas from the Early Concepts to Relativity and Quanta. This book is incredibly insightful. It is a very conceptual book.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Out of My Later Years, 1950 - </em></strong>In this I gives my personal credos, my profound convictions on the most urgent questions of modern society: social, religious, educational and racial relationships, and the problem of peace.</p>

            <p>Einstein skipped the Nobel Prize ceremonies to take a trip to the Far East.

                “I have decided definitely not to ride around the world so much anymore; but am I going to be able to pull that off, too?” he wrote his sons after his 1922 trip to Japan.
                
                Unlike most of us, for Einstein travel was more than an escape from the mundane: The physicist acknowledges that the assassination that year of Germany’s foreign minister Walther Rathenau by right-wing extremists helped persuade him to leave Germany for a while.
                
                Those same dark forces led to his eventual emigration to the United States from Europe, to escape Hitler’s spreading destruction of Germany’s Jews.Most of my original scientific work appeared as journal articles.</p>
            <p>Article on the Thermodynamic Theory of the Difference in Potentials between Metals and Fully Dissociated Solutions of Their Salts and on an Electrical Method for Investigating Molecular Forces in the year 1902.</p>
            <p>Kinetic Theory of Thermal Equilibrium and of the Second Law of Thermodynamics in the year 1902.</p>
            <p>A Theory of the Foundations of Thermodynamics in the year 1903.</p>
            <p>An article on the General Molecular Theory of Heat in the year 1904.</p>
            <p>Review of Albert Fliegner: "On Clausius's Law of Entropy",Review of William McFadden Orr: "On Clausius' Theorem for Irreversible Cycles, and on the Increase of Entropy",Review of George Hartley Bryan: "The Law of Degradation of Energy as the Fundamental Principle of Thermodynamics" in the year 1905.</p>
            <p>Remarks on Our Paper: On the Fundamental Electromagnetic Equations for Moving Bodies in the year 1909.</p>
            <p>The Speed of Light and the Statics of the Gravitational Field in 1912.</p>
            <p>“Both of us, alas, dead drunk under the table,” Einstein wrote, referring to himself and his wife MilevaMaric, in a 1915 postcard sent to his pal Conrad Habicht.

                Habicht was a co-founder of the Olympia Academy in Bern, Switzerland, a drinking club where friends debated philosophy and science.
                
                “The young Einstein was a Bohemian, not the sage we think of now,” Stanley says. Much like a dorm-room bull session, “that’s what young people did then; they hung out in beer halls and argued about the nature of space and time.”
                
                Einstein later said the club had a great effect on his career.</p>
